# Stock-Market-Price-Analysis-Project

# OverView


This project leverages Apache Spark for big data processing to analyze stock market price trends efficiently.  
Using PySpark on Databricks, we perform data ingestion, transformation, and visualization of large-scale stock market data.  
The project explores key data engineering techniques, including ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data cleaning, feature engineering, and time-series analysis.

By utilizing Sparkâ€™s distributed computing power, this analysis helps uncover market trends, volatility patterns, and predictive insights.  
The project demonstrates how to handle real-world financial data and optimize big data workflows in a scalable cloud environment.
